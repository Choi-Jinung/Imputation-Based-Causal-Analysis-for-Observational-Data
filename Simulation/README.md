- **conditional_independence_O:** Represents a scenario where conditional independence holds between the two potential outcomes, \( Y(1-T) \) and \( Y(T) \), given the pre-treatment variables \( X \).  
- **conditional_independence_X:** Represents a scenario where conditional independence does not hold between the two potential outcomes, \( Y(1-T) \) and \( Y(T) \), given the pre-treatment variables \( X \).
