- **PSM.R:** Implements a propensity score matching estimator using the MatchIt package.  
- **Regression_CI.R:** Provides a deterministic regression estimator under the assumption of conditional independence between the two potential outcomes, given pre-treatment variables.  
- **bootstrap.R:** Includes code for implementing a bootstrap-based variance estimator for average treatment effects.  
- **fractional imputation_single.R:** Implements statistical matching using the fractional imputation method proposed by Kim et al. (2016).  
- **variance_estimation_single.R:** Contains code for the linearization-based variance estimator of the fractional imputation estimator, as proposed by Kim et al. (2016). For further details, refer to:
