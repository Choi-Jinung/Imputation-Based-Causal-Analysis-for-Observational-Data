# Imputation-Based-Causal-Analysis-for-Observational-Data

This repository contains the R code supporting the following publication:  

**Choi, J., Joo, H. R., Kim, J., Choeh, J. Y., and Im, J. (2024), “Imputation-Based Causal Analysis for Observational Data.”**

The repository is organized into the following folders:  

- **Functions:** Includes functions utilized in both real data analysis and simulation studies.  
- **Real Data Analysis:** Contains code for applying causal inference methods to Indiegogo web-crawling data. Note that the actual dataset is not included due to confidentiality restrictions.  
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Provides code for assessing the sensitivity of the proposed fractional imputation method to model assumptions, using the Indiegogo web-crawling data.  
- **Simulation:** Includes code for simulation studies comparing the performance of causal inference methods under varying conditional independence scenarios.
